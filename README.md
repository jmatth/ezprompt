EzPrompt
========

EzPrompt is a webapp that makes the usually tedious task of creating bash prompt
strings quick and easy. Now instead of having to write a `PS1` by hand, you can
just select the elements you want, adjust them in a live preview, and when
you're done simply copy the generated code into your bashrc.
